# buddha-sasana-redesign
Redesign of the Buddha Sasana website.

### Explanation
Access to Insight, a website well known among buddhist practitioners of the Theravada tradition, and accepted by all other traditions, communicated its shutdown in late 2021.

As we knew the maintainers and were practitioners with good networking, we were able to get the original website and restructure it in a more modern way.

With this work involving many volunteers, the website can remain accessible to the buddhist community, something considered very valuable as it holds thousands of sacred texts.
